Exciting news! It's now possible to search for a product by its SKU. All you need is to have the latest version of WooCommerce available on your store! We also focused on polishing a few things and taking care of minor bugs that our team found, like making it easier for you to login to the app and fixing a rare crash when selecting a store in the store picker.

נשמח להמשיך לקבל משוב, זה עוזר לנו להבין על מה כדאי לנו לעבוד בשלב הבא. 💜
